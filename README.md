There are 25 files, being one for each calendar year. 
Each file has been zipped to minimise storage space. 
There are no headers in the file, only data. 
Header details are list below (in the order the columns appear in each file). 
Columns are delimited by comma. 
Text is delimited by double-quotes (ie. ", not two single-quotes). 
Rows are delimited by CRLF. 


|Data item|Explanation (where appropriate)|
|---------|-------------------------------|
|Transaction unique identifier	|A reference number which is generated automatically recording each published sale. The number is unique and will change each time a sale is recorded.|
|Price	|Sale price stated on the transfer deed.|
|Date of Transfer	|Date when the sale was completed, as stated on the transfer deed.|
|Postcode	|This is the postcode used at the time of the original transaction. Note that postcodes can be reallocated and these changes are not reflected in the Price Paid Dataset.|
|Property Type	|D = Detached, S = Semi-Detached, T = Terraced, F = Flats/Maisonettes, O = Other.  Note that i) HM Land Registry only record the above categories to describe property type, they do not separately identify bungalows, ii) end-of-terrace properties are included in the Terraced category, iii) ‘Other’ is only valid where the transaction relates to a property type that is not covered by existing values.|
|Old/New	|Indicates the age of the property and applies to all price paid transactions, residential and non-residential. Y = a newly built property, N = an established residential building|
|Duration	|Relates to the tenure: F = Freehold, L= Leasehold etc. Note that HM Land Registry does not record leases of 7 years or less in the Price Paid Dataset.|
|PAON	|Primary Addressable Object Name. Typically the house number or name.|
|SAON	|Secondary Addressable Object Name. Where a property has been divided into separate units (for example, flats), the PAON (above) will identify the building and a SAON will be specified that identifies the separate unit/flat.|

|Locality	 ||
|Town/City	 ||
|District	 ||
|County	 ||
|PPD Category Type	|Indicates the type of Price Paid transaction. A = Standard Price Paid entry, includes single residential property sold for value. B = Additional Price Paid entry including transfers under a power of sale/repossessions, buy-to-lets (where they can be identified by a Mortgage) and transfers to non-private individuals. Note that category B does not separately identify the transaction types stated. HM Land Registry has been collecting information on Category A transactions from January 1995. Category B transactions were identified from October 2013.|
|Record Status - monthly file only	|Indicates additions, changes and deletions to the records. A = Addition, C = Change, D = Delete. Note that where a transaction changes category type due to misallocation (as above) it will be deleted from the original category type and added to the correct category with a new transaction unique identifier.|
